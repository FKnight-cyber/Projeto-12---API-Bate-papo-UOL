## Projeto 12 API-Bate-papo-UOL

This project's goal was to create a back-end application for the past "Bate-papo-Uol" front-end project developed previously on this course, 
the api is done with express.js, mongoDB was used to store data, validations were made with joi lib and string-strip-html lib was used to sanitize the data 
before store it on the mongo database.
